## Computer Graphics from Scratch

### A NU-MECH-ENG-495 Project

Computer graphics from scratch! In this project, built entirely in C++, I've created a simple graphics viewer capable of rendering triangle-based 3D objects, like STL files. Here are a few examples of it in action. The colors of each face are randomized to make it easier to distinguish the different triangle surfaces.

You can watch some example videos here:

### How to run

Build the project and run CPP_Project. For Gtest, run "test/3D Test".
